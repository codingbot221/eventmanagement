The College Event Management System is a React-based web application designed to store, manage, and view college event details efficiently. It provides an intuitive UI for organizing event data, including event names, dates, descriptions, images, and categories. The system uses React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend, ensuring smooth data handling and persistence. Users can add, update, and retrieve event details with a structured database approach.
